I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley. I work on topics at the intersection of labor, macro, and behavioral economics. I am particularly interested in questions of household finance like the ways households smooth out shocks to their income and wealth.

Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked as a pre-doctoral fellow at the [Opportunity Insights Lab](https://opportunityinsights.org/), and I hold an M.Sc. from Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. You can find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8jmjnbfrxfxqa2f/CV_Website.pdf?dl=0).

If you want to talk about research (mine or yours!), please [get in touch](mailto:nflamang@berkeley.edu).
